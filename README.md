# local-turtle-explorer

If you are a TRTL, explorer other TRTLs locally!

Just download and extract the release .zip file. You will find Local_Turtle_Explorer.exe there.

When you start the local explorer, it will initiate the RPC daemon itself, there is nothing else you need to do.

Please note that the local explorer will start the daemon which other users can connect to your daemon. 
The option of choosing the daemon starting mode might be added in the future.

*The status bar in the window disappear ocassionally, it is a known issue; however, after some research, it might be a bug in Qt5.
We will find a solution for this issue in the future.

Feel free to suggest anything or report any issue.
